# Savings Calculator

A GraphQL API for calculating the future value of a savings pot and determining the necessary monthly savings to reach a target pot size.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

Start the NestJS application:

```
npm run start
```

### Running the Application using Apollo

1. Open your web browser

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/graphql to access the GraphQL Playground

3. Write and execute mutations in the left-side editor

4. Click the play button to run the mutation

5. Observe the right side of the GraphQL Playground panel. The mutations return both `inputs` and `results`. You can further elaborate if needed, but this provides a brief indication of what to expect in the response.

Try executing the provided mutations with your desired inputs:

#### Calculate Future Value:

```
mutation {
  calculateFutureValue(input: {
    currentPotSize: 1000,
    regularMonthlyAmount: 50,
    annualGrowthRate: 0.05,
    numberOfYears: 5
  }) {
    currentPotSize,
    regularMonthlyAmount,
    annualGrowthRate,
    numberOfYears,
    futureValue
  }
}

```

A successful calculation of Future Value would be:

#### Calculate Target Monthly Savings:

```
mutation {
  calculateTargetMonthlySavings(input: {
    currentPotSize: 1000,
    futureValue: 15000,
    annualGrowthRate: 0.03,
    numberOfYears: 5
  }) {
    currentPotSize,
    futureValue,
    annualGrowthRate,
    numberOfYears,
    regularMonthlyAmount
  }
}
```

A successful calculation of the Target Monthly Savings would be:

### Running the Application using Postman

1. Open your Postman application
2. Create a new request:

- Set the request method to `POST`
- Set the request URL to http://localhost:3000/graphql.
- In the request body, select GraphQL and enter the mutation.
  You can use the mutations provided above (with the inputs) directly to the `Query` area or do the following approach:

Fill in the `Query`:

```
mutation CalculateFutureValue($input: CalculateFutureValueInputDto!) {
  calculateFutureValue(input: $input) {
    currentPotSize
    regularMonthlyAmount
    annualGrowthRate
    numberOfYears
    futureValue
  }
}

```

and fill you desired inputs in `GraphQL variables` on the right side of the screen, for example:

```
{
  "input": {
    "currentPotSize": 1000,
    "regularMonthlyAmount": 50,
    "annualGrowthRate": 0.05,
    "numberOfYears": 5
  }
}
```

Same applies for the second mutation:

```
mutation CalculateTargetMonthlySavings($input: TargetMonthlySavingsInputDto!) {
  calculateTargetMonthlySavings(input: $input) {
    currentPotSize
    futureValue
    annualGrowthRate
    numberOfYears
    regularMonthlyAmount
  }
}
```

and

```
{
  "input": {
    "currentPotSize": 1000,
    "futureValue": 10000,
    "annualGrowthRate": 0.05,
    "numberOfYears": 5
  }
}
```

3. Click the "Send" button to make the request.
4. Observe the response in the body of the Postman response panel. The mutations return both `inputs` and `results`. You can further elaborate if needed, but this provides a brief indication of what to expect in the response.

A successful calculation of Future Value would be:

A successful calculation of the Target Monthly Savings would be:

### Testing

I have implemented unit testing (`savings.service.spec.ts`) for the services covering various scenarios, including edge cases, min/max inputs etc.

Included also an end-to-end test (`savings.e2e-spec.ts`) to ensure proper enforcement of min/max values through DTO validators and GraphQL functionalities coverage, verifying that input type mismatches result in appropriate error messages. (While this e2e test covers some key cases, it is not exhaustively cover all possible scenarios, just did it for a quick check for now. In a real life application this would be handled in detail ðŸ˜Š)

In order to run these tests:

- For unit testing:

```
npm run test
```

- For e2e testing:

```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Error Handling

The Savings Calculator API is designed to handle incorrect or missing inputs by providing informative messages. Other edge cases and the way they are approached, are described in the section below.

## Technical Decisions

In a real-life application, the determination of these decisions would be a collaborative decision involving discussions with the development team, financial experts and stakeholders to align with the app's intended use cases and industry standards.
In order to complete this task though, I took roughly these decisions:

### Input Types and Value Limits

- Used `Float` type for `currentPotSize`, `regularMonthlyAmount`, `futureValue` and `annualGrowthRate`. `Int` type is used for `numberOfYears`
- The selected input value limits for the variables have been chosen to accommodate a broad range of financial scenarios while preventing extreme or unrealistic values.

### Handling edge cases

#### 1. Annual Growth Rate is 0

When annual growth rate is 0, there is a risk of having a NaN (since we divide with 0). In order to handle this:

- The future value is the sum of the initial pot size and total contributions over the years

```
futureValue = currentPotSize + regularMonthlyAmount * 12 * numberOfYears
```

- The monthly savings is the difference between future value and current pot size, divided by the total number of months

```
regularMonthlyAmount = (futureValue - currentPotSize) / (12 * numberOfYears)
```

#### 2. Negative Result in Monthly Savings Amount

In some edge cases, when the
monthly savings target is calculated the result is negative.
I checked that some calculators online return the negative result, while others return 0 (like this [one](https://moneysmart.gov.au/saving/savings-goals-calculator#!focus=1))

Typically, when calculating the necessary monthly savings, you would expect a positive value indicating the amount you need to contribute regularly to achieve the specified future value (at least I have this idea, I'm not so aware of economical terms - yet :P)

In the scope of this API, I decided that the implementation ensures that a negative result is treated as zero.

#### 3. Future Value is bigger or equal than Current Pot Size

Again in the case of calculating the monthly savings target,
some online calculators don't have a special way to handle this exception.

In the scope of this API, I decided that if the Future Value is bigger or equal than Current Pot Size then the goal is achieved so the regular monthly amount needed is zero.

#### 4. Rounding in Financial Calculations

The application does not round the calculated values. The API returns precise results for calculations, prioritizing accuracy.

#### 5. Error handling for incorrect variable types or inputs

`class-validator` is used extensively in the DTO in order to ensure that the inputs have the valid type and are in the allowed range. If you try to put wrong type, value out of range or omit to put a variable necessary for this certain service, then an Error is thrown.

## Notes

I've observed a slight variance in results compared to the online calculator provided by the resources. Despite adhering closely to the provided formulas, discrepancies might arise from rounding or precision differences. I value precision and welcome feedback or guidance to align with expected results. Additionally, insights into rounding or precision conventions for this calculation would be appreciated.
